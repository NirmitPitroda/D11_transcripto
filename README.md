# Speech-to-Text Models with Deep Learning

## Overview

This project explores various audio processing techniques and deep learning architectures to develop effective speech-to-text models. It leverages a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for feature extraction and temporal modeling of speech. In addition, a state-of-the-art Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system is built using transformer-based models, which have shown significant promise in boosting performance. The models are evaluated under both clean and noisy conditions to gauge their effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

## Features

- **Audio Preprocessing:** Robust techniques for handling and cleaning audio data in various conditions.
- **Deep Learning Architectures:**
  - CNNs for extracting salient features.
  - RNNs and LSTMs to capture sequential and temporal dependencies.
  - Transformer-based models for advanced speech recognition.
- **Comparative Evaluation:** Performance assessment under varying noise levels using metrics such as Word Error Rate (WER).
