Overview
This project explores various audio processing techniques and deep learning architectures to develop effective speech-to-text models. It leverages a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for feature extraction and temporal modeling of speech. In addition, a state-of-the-art Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system is built using transformer-based models, which have shown significant promise in boosting performance. The models are evaluated under both clean and noisy conditions to gauge their effectiveness in real-world scenarios.
Features

    Audio Preprocessing: Robust techniques for handling and cleaning audio data in various conditions.
    Deep Learning Architectures:
        CNNs for extracting salient features.
        RNNs and LSTMs to capture sequential and temporal dependencies.
        Transformer-based models for advanced speech recognition.
    Comparative Evaluation: Performance assessment under varying noise levels using metrics such as Word Error Rate (WER).
