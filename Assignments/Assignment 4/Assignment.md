```


----------

## **Task 1: Audio Data Preprocessing and Feature Extraction**

Load, explore, and preprocess the audio data to prepare it for sequence modeling.

### **1. Data Loading and Exploration**

-   Use `torchaudio.datasets.SPEECHCOMMANDS` to load the dataset. Explore its structure.
-   Select a subset of classes (10).
-   Visualize the raw audio waveforms for a few samples from different classes using `matplotlib`.
-   Listen to some audio samples to get a feel for the data.
-   Analyze and report the distribution of audio clip durations. Note that they might have variable lengths.
-   Check the sampling rate (should be consistent, typically 16kHz for this dataset).

### **2. Feature Extraction using Torchaudio**

-   Choose a primary feature representation:
    -   **Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs):** Use `torchaudio.transforms.MFCC`. Decide on parameters like `n_mfcc`, `melkwargs` (which includes `n_fft`, `hop_length`, `n_mels`).
    -   **Log-Mel Spectrograms:** Use `torchaudio.transforms.MelSpectrogram` followed by a log transformation (`torch.log` or `torchaudio.transforms.AmplitudeToDB`). This is often preferred for CNN-based approaches but can also work for RNNs.
-   Visualize the chosen features (MFCCs or Log-Mel Spectrograms) for a few samples.
-   **Crucial Step: Handling Variable Lengths:** Since RNNs/LSTMs require fixed-length sequences within a batch, you need a strategy:
    -   **Padding/Truncation:** Determine a maximum sequence length. Pad shorter sequences (e.g., with zeros) and truncate longer ones. `torch.nn.utils.rnn.pad_sequence` can be helpful when creating batches in your `DataLoader`.
-   **Feature Scaling:** Standardize the features (e.g., subtract mean and divide by standard deviation) across the *training dataset*. Apply the *same* scaling to validation and test sets.

### **3. Data Splitting and Loading**

-   Create Train-Test-Validation Datasets.
-   Create custom PyTorch `Dataset` classes (or use functional approaches) to handle loading audio, applying transforms, and padding/truncation.
-   Use `torch.utils.data.DataLoader` to create efficient data loaders for training, validation, and testing, specifying `batch_size` and potentially a `collate_fn` if you need custom batching logic (especially for padding).

----------

## **Task 2: Baseline Model with RNN for Audio Classification**

Develop and evaluate a simple RNN model.

### **1. Model Architecture (PyTorch)**

-   Design a model using `torch.nn.Module`.
-   Include one or more `torch.nn.RNN` layers.
-   Input to the RNN should be the processed features (e.g., MFCCs) with shape `(batch_size, seq_length, num_features)`.
-   Consider taking the output of the last time step of the RNN or using an aggregation method (like mean pooling) over the time steps.
-   Add a `torch.nn.Linear` layer as the final classifier with output units equal to the number of classes.
-   Use a suitable activation function (like LogSoftmax or rely on `nn.CrossEntropyLoss` which combines LogSoftmax and NLLLoss).

### **2. Model Training and Evaluation**

-   Choose an appropriate loss function (e.g., `torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss`).
-   Select an optimizer (e.g., `torch.optim.Adam`).
-   Implement a training loop: iterate through epochs and batches, perform forward pass, calculate loss, perform backward pass (`loss.backward()`), and update weights (`optimizer.step()`). Remember to zero gradients (`optimizer.zero_grad()`).
-   Implement an evaluation loop (run on the validation set after each epoch): Set the model to evaluation mode (`model.eval()`), disable gradient calculations (`with torch.no_grad():`), calculate validation loss and accuracy.
-   Track and plot training and validation loss and accuracy curves versus epochs using `matplotlib`.
-   After training, evaluate the final model on the test set.
-   Calculate and visualize a confusion matrix using `scikit-learn` (`sklearn.metrics.confusion_matrix`, `ConfusionMatrixDisplay`) to understand class-specific performance. Report overall test accuracy and potentially other metrics like F1-score.

----------

## **Task 3: Advanced Model with LSTM Networks**

Implement an LSTM-based model to potentially capture longer-range dependencies.

### **1. Model Architecture (PyTorch)**

-   Modify the baseline model architecture:
    -   Replace `torch.nn.RNN` layers with `torch.nn.LSTM` layers.
    -   **Experiment:** Try using `bidirectional=True` in the LSTM layer(s). Remember this changes the output shape and hidden state dimensions. You might need to adjust how you process the LSTM output before the final linear layer (e.g., concatenate the final forward and backward hidden states).
-   Incorporate regularization techniques:
    -   Add `torch.nn.Dropout` layers strategically (e.g., after LSTM layers or before the final linear layer) to reduce overfitting.
    -   Consider `torch.nn.BatchNorm1d` on the features *before* feeding them into the RNN/LSTM, or potentially between linear layers (be careful applying batch norm directly on RNN/LSTM outputs across time steps).

### **2. Model Training and Evaluation**

-   Train the LSTM model using the same training procedure as the baseline RNN.
-   Compare its training/validation curves (loss, accuracy) with the baseline RNN model. Did LSTM provide an improvement? Was it faster or slower to train?
-   Evaluate the final LSTM model on the test set.
-   Generate and analyze its confusion matrix. Compare it directly with the RNN's confusion matrix. Are the types of errors different?

----------

## **Task 4: Final Analysis and Bonus Exploration**

Analyze model performance and explore potential improvements.

### **1. Error Analysis and Model Improvement**

-   Examine the confusion matrices from both models. Which classes are most often confused? Listen to some misclassified audio samples. Can you hypothesize why the models made these errors?
-   Experiment with feature extraction parameters:
    -   Change `n_mfcc`
    -   Adjust `n_fft`, `hop_length`, or `n_mels` in the spectrogram/MFCC calculation. How do these changes affect performance?
    -   Try using Log-Mel Spectrograms instead of MFCCs (or vice-versa).
-   Tune model hyperparameters:
    -   Learning rate.
    -   Number of RNN/LSTM layers.
    -   Number of hidden units in RNN/LSTM layers.
    -   Dropout rate.
    -   Optimizer (e.g., try SGD with momentum, AdamW).
-   Implement **Data Augmentation:** Use `torchaudio.transforms` like `TimeStretch`, `FrequencyMasking`, `TimeMasking`, or adding noise to the raw audio *before* feature extraction. This can significantly improve robustness. Apply augmentations only during training.

### **2. Bonus Challenge: CNN-LSTM Hybrid Model**

-   Design and implement a model that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and LSTMs.
-   **Input:** Use Mel Spectrograms (treated like a 1D or 2D "image" where one dimension is time and the other is frequency).
-   **Architecture:**
    -   Use 1D CNNs (`torch.nn.Conv1d`) across the time dimension or 2D CNNs (`torch.nn.Conv2d`) over the spectrogram image. Apply activation functions (e.g., ReLU) and potentially `torch.nn.MaxPool1d` / `torch.nn.MaxPool2d`.
    -   The CNN layers act as feature extractors. Reshape/permute the output of the CNN layers so it has the correct shape `(batch_size, seq_length, features)` to be fed into LSTM layers.
    -   Use one or more LSTM (or BiLSTM) layers to model the temporal sequences extracted by the CNN.
    -   Add a final classification layer (`torch.nn.Linear`).
-   Train and evaluate this hybrid model. Compare its performance (accuracy, loss, confusion matrix) against the standalone LSTM model. Does this combination yield better results for this task?
