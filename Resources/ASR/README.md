# Understanding and Building an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) System

Welcome! This guide is designed to walk you through the fundamentals of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), demonstrate the process of building one by fine-tuning an existing model, and provide a practical implementation example.

## Learning Path

Please follow the materials in the order below for a structured learning experience:

1.  üìÑ **`WhatisanASR.md`**
    *   **Purpose:** Start here to grasp the fundamental concepts of ASR. This document will cover what ASR is, its core components, common terminology, and its applications.
    *   **Focus:** Theoretical understanding and big-picture overview.

2.  üõ†Ô∏è **`asrbuild.md`**
    *   **Purpose:** Once you understand the basics, this document will guide you through the general process of fine-tuning a pre-trained ASR model. It will outline the typical steps involved, from data preparation to model evaluation.
    *   **Focus:** Process-oriented understanding of fine-tuning.

3.  üíª **`asrfinetune.ipynb`**
    *   **Purpose:** This Jupyter Notebook provides a hands-on, practical example of fine-tuning an ASR model. You'll see the concepts from `asrbuild.md` put into action with actual code.
    *   **Focus:** Practical implementation and coding.

4.  ‚ùì **`understanding-asrfinetune`** (e.g., `understanding-asrfinetune.md` or another notebook)
    *   **Purpose:** If you encounter difficulties understanding the code or concepts within `asrfinetune.ipynb`, refer to this file. It likely contains more detailed explanations, common pitfalls, or a breakdown of complex sections.
    *   **Focus:** Deeper dive and troubleshooting for the practical example.
